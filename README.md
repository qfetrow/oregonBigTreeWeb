# OregonBigTreeWeb

This is a Web version of the App I developed earlier this year.  I'm using Angular and Tailwind CSS and reverse engineering everything I did in swift to gain experience in web development. The webapp acquires measure and meeting data from Oregon Legislatures public ODATA api.

# Purpose

The goal of both the app and the webpage is to connect Oregonians to their local legislators and allow citizens to make sense of Oregon's legislative systems.  I want to make it easy for people to track state legislature and get their voices heard by their representatives.

# Functionalities

Right now the website is limited.  It supports users selecting a committee and viewing measures that are currently in those committees.
